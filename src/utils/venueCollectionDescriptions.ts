  Novel:
    "These venues are our best-kept secrets—they might be lower in price because they’re a little more rustic, DIY, or located outside the hustle and bustle of the Valley. A little extra drive, a lot more savings.",
  Fable:
    "These venues are flexible in price—choose an off-season date, a weekday, or keep your guest count smaller and you’ll see real savings. Book a peak weekend with a larger crowd, and the price climbs. These are a choose-you-own-adventure kind of castle!",
  Romance:
    "These venues lean toward the luxury end—refined spaces, iconic settings, and timeless details that come with a higher price tag. If you’re dreaming of elegance and grandeur, this collection is built for it.",
